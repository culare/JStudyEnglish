1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,560
My name is Turkish.

2
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,840
Funny name for an Englishman, I know.

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,400
My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
They named me after the plane.

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,440
Not many people are
named after a plane crash.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,560
That's Tommy.

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,920
He tells people
he was named after a gun.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th century ballet dancer.

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,800
Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,200
It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,200
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,840
But really, he's like my brother.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,720
I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then...

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,080
What do I know about diamonds?

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,880
Don't they come from Antwerp?

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,920
-Himy, would you listen to this?
-Do we have a choice?

19
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,720
It wasn't meant to be taken literally.

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,640
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
It's bound with moral fibre...

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,560
...but asking a grown man
to believe it?

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,720
What is it?

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,320
Well, what is it?

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,120
What you want I should do,
drop my pants?

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay, go through.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,200
It's a nice story.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,720
It's just that. Just a story.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,840
Enough already. Ruben, say something.

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
...into the Greek word for "virgin."

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,720
It was an easy mistake to make...

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,320
...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,960
So, they came up with a prophecy.:

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,240
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. "

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,360
You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,640
It's not everyday a virgin conceives
and bears a son.

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.

42
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,040
Oy vay, what are you saying?

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm saying, just because
it's written...

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,480
...doesn't make it so.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear anymore.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,400
Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,600
-Michael.
-Hello?

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,440
Mutti.

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,960
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,160
-Michael.
-Mutti.

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,880
You've kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,520
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,880
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,360
-Get down!
-Get fucking down!

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
On the ground!

61
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,960
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,160
-Time.
-Seven minutes!

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,960
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,080
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,080
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,560
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,200
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,400
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,600
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,600
When you get to London...

71
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,600
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
...call this number.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,160
-Boris.
-Boris.

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,080
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,480
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,200
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

79
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,200
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,880
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,960
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,720
Why me?

84
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,240
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
How's that?

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,360
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,680
And I don't want to have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,640
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm just not sure about the colour.

92
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,800
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,760
Here's an address.

94
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,800
It's a campsite.

95
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,200
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
-What's happening with them sausages?
-Five minutes.

97
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,640
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,440
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,240
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,000
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,600
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,560
-What's that?
-It's me belt.

103
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,040
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,280
-What's a gun doing in your trousers?
-It's for protection.

105
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
Protection from what?

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,680
"Zee" Germans?

107
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

108
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
-Where did you get it?
-Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,920
You mean Boris the sneaky,
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,080
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,880
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,240
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,200
Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.

115
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,600
Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.

116
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,720
Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.

117
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,520
Back to my partner, Tommy.

118
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,520
Tommy runs the other business...

119
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,320
...the slot machines...

120
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,960
...which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.

121
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,360
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.

122
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,760
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,760
There's a reason for Tommy's newfound
enthusiasm for firearms.

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,280
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:

125
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,720
Brick Top.

126
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,480
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

127
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,680
-He doesn't look bad, does he?
-No, he looks great.

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,280
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,440
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

130
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,680
It's what you deserve.

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,200
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,760
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
No. No, I'm not.

135
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,960
However...

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,280
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,720
All except loyalty.

138
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,200
It's rumoured that his favourite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...

139
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,440
...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,880
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,160
If you got to deal with him, just
make sure you don't end up owing him.

145
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,600
Then you're in his debt.

146
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,960
Which means, you're in his pocket.

147
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,440
And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.

148
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,040
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll be doing you a favour, boy.

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,400
What he means is,
I'm doing him a favour.

151
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Because everybody knows nobody takes
a dive in my fights. Unlike his.

152
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,680
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

153
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,320
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,840
Don't know what you mean.

155
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,960
I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.

156
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,240
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,640
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,240
You can sort me out by showing me out.

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,200
It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...

160
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,880
...you do something
against your principles.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Basically, you have to forget
you got any.

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,600
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Who's talking to you?

164
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,720
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.

165
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Don't let me down.

166
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
You don't want to let me down, do you?

167
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,560
See you ringside.

168
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,880
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,600
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

171
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,960
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,880
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,400
But don't you hit him either.

174
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,600
Americans can't know it was Russian.

175
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,440
It will come back to me.

176
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,440
You're my brother, so think like it.

177
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,560
Get somebody else to steal that stone!

178
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,800
I don't want it getting back to me.

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,800
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

180
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,720
So don't use idiots for the job.

181
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,440
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to new York...

182
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,000
...so move quick. Okay?

183
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
One more thing.

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
It might help.

185
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
He loves to gamble.

186
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,240
Eighty-six carats?

187
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,360
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

188
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,520
A beautiful stone.

189
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
You're a good boy, Franky.

190
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,960
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

191
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,800
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

192
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,440
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Doug The Head?

193
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,080
And Franky....

194
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,720
-And what?
-Stay out of those casinos.

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,640
You did a good job, bubbe.

196
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,680
-Don't go screwing it up, all right?
-I hear you, Avi.

197
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,200
I'll see you, Avi.

198
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,560
Eighty-six carats.

199
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,360
-Where?
-London.

200
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,120
-London?
-London.

201
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
-London?
-Yes, London.

202
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

203
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,000
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,880
Not for me.

205
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,120
That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.

206
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,760
If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.

207
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,280
Pretends he's Jewish.

208
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,000
Wishes he was Jewish.

209
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,360
Even tells his family
they're Jewish...

210
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,760
...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.

211
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,800
He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...

212
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,320
-...it is good for business.
-Avi!

213
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,560
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

214
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,320
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

215
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,080
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

216
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

217
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,280
We play by the rules.

218
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
Listen to me.

219
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,200
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

220
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,200
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

221
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,360
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,360
It's a free country, isn't it?

223
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

224
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
So fuck off.

225
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,120
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

226
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,360
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

227
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,240
-You got to go see him.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,680
-He's a big mucker in new York.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,280
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

230
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,880
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,640
The weight is sign of reliability.

232
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,400
I always go for reliability.

233
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,800
I'll take it.

234
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,560
How much do you want for it?

235
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,920
Nothing.

236
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Okay, so what do you want for it?

237
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,280
I want you to do something for me.

238
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,040
There is a fight in couple of days.

239
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
What kind of a fight?

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,600
Unlicensed boxing.

241
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,800
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

242
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,400
If you place one down for me...

243
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
...we will call it quits.

244
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,880
-Why don't you put it down yourself?
-Well...

245
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,280
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

246
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,520
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

247
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,080
I know something most don't.

248
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,400
So, nu?

249
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000
What do you know?

250
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,120
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

251
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,240
-Ten points.
-What are we doing here?

252
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,160
-We're buying a caravan.
-Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

253
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,200
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

254
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,240
Not if you're here.

255
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,240
Oh, you bastard.

256
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,880
I fucking hate pikeys.

257
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,120
That's a flash car, mister.

258
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,760
Not as flash as your bike.

259
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,840
Who are you looking for?

260
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,280
Mr. O'Neil.

261
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,160
-Want me to get him?
-That's a good lad.

262
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,080
Piss off.

263
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,480
-Are you going to go get him for me?
-Yeah.

264
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,320
-What are you waiting for?
-The five quid you'll pay me.

265
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

266
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,600
-Two fifty.
-You can have a quid.

267
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,320
You're a real tight fucker.

268
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,520
There was a problem with gypsies.

269
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,160
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

270
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,360
You can't understand
what's being said.

271
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,120
You Tommy? Come about the caravan?

272
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,520
-Mr. O'Neil.
-Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
Not Irish, not English.

274
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,640
-How are you?
-Weather's been kind.

275
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,520
It's just Pikey.

276
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,800
Would you look at the size of him?

277
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,800
How big are you?

278
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,960
-Kids, how big is he?
-Big, for sure.

279
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,720
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

280
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,960
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

281
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,680
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

282
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
I could murder one.

283
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

284
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,480
Get your hands out of there.

285
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,240
Cup of tea for the big fella?

286
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,480
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

287
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,040
You little bugger.

288
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,320
-Is the big fella not coming with us?
-He's minding the car.

289
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,200
-What does he think we are, thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

290
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,440
-He just likes looking after cars.
-Good dags. Do you like dags?

291
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,400
-Dags?
-What?

292
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,640
-Yeah, dags.
-Dags. You like dags?

293
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,800
Oh, dogs.

294
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
Sure, I like dags.

295
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
-I like caravans more.
-You're very welcome.

296
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,120
Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.

297
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,280
It's probably why
they talk like that...

298
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
...so you can't follow
what's being said.

299
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,080
But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
...on his return
there will be ice cream.

301
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,560
Good dog, good family.

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,400
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

303
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,400
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

304
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,720
All right, Mickey. Laters.

305
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
I don't see what the fuss is about.

306
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,480
They aren't bad fellas.

307
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,400
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

308
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,600
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

309
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,600
See that car? Use it.

310
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,320
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

311
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,400
Nobody brings you...

312
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,400
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

313
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,120
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

314
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,280
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

315
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,520
-You want to settle this with a fight?
-Over my dead body.

316
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,040
Now, go on! Go on!

317
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,080
I'll not have you fighting!
You know what happens when you fight!

318
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,000
Get her to sit down.

319
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,200
For fuck's sake!

320
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,840
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

321
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,520
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

322
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,200
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

323
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,560
You want to stay down.

324
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,760
You want to stay down!

325
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,080
Get back down and fucking stay down.

326
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,640
I promise you, you want to stay down.

327
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,880
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

328
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,040
Cheeky bastard.

329
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,480
-Okay, lads.
-Get him on his feet.

330
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,880
Get back down...

331
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,800
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

332
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Bollocks to you.

333
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,360
This is sick. I'm out of here.

334
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,040
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

335
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,080
You stay until the job's done.

336
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,280
It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...

337
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,200
...was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.

338
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,040
Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.

339
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.

340
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,200
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...

341
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,600
...Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.

342
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,760
Why would the gypsies
want to explain...

343
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
...why a man died in their campsite?

344
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,400
Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.

345
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,000
It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?

346
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,480
Tommy, "The Tit"...

347
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,280
...is praying.

348
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,760
And if he isn't...

349
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,960
...he fucking should be.

350
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,760
Bad Boy.

351
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,040
-Sol.
-Easy.

352
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,920
No, it's a moissanite.

353
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,040
A what?

354
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,520
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

355
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,760
It's Mickey Mouse.

356
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
Spurious.

357
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
Not genuine.

358
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,920
And it's worth...

359
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,400
...fuck-all.

360
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,480
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

361
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,480
Leave this game to me and Sol.

362
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,040
Laters.

363
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
What is that, Vince?

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
This is a dog, Sol.

365
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

366
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
It's only a fucking dog.

367
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,480
-Where'd you get it?
-The gyppos.

368
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Here.

369
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,720
They threw it in with the moody gold.

370
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

371
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,840
It better not be dangerous.

372
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,680
What do you think you're doing now?

373
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,920
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

374
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,360
Stop the dog!

375
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
Come back!

376
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,680
All right, Boris?

377
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,560
-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.

378
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
What can I do for you?

379
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,680
I have a job for you.

380
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,560
I already have a job.

381
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,120
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

382
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Go on.

383
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,800
I want you to hold up a bookies.

384
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,080
From Russia with love, eh?

385
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,040
I have stones to sell...

386
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,280
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

387
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,000
...so if I am not rushing you....

388
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,880
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

389
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,280
I am not in Rome, Doug.

390
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,120
I am in a rush.

391
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,920
I got to make the bookies.

392
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,320
Bookies?

393
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
-What are you betting on?
-Bomber Harris.

394
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,520
The unlicensed boxer?

395
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
Do you know something that I don't?

396
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,000
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

397
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,760
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

398
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,160
Of course I am.

399
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,040
Tyrone'll drive for us. He's
done a rally driving course.

400
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,440
Of course I have.

401
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,800
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

402
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,480
Your seats?

403
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,880
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

404
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,960
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

405
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,400
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

406
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,400
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

407
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,280
It went back to the gyppos.

408
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,120
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

409
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,480
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

410
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,280
Ask him.

411
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,080
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

412
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,080
Steady on the brakes.

413
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

414
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,360
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

415
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,040
All right?

416
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,920
What?

417
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,880
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

418
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,840
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

419
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,560
Worry about getting us a gun.

420
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
What's that?

421
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,040
This is a shotgun, Sol.

422
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

423
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,000
-I want to raise pulses, don't I?
-You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

424
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,880
That does not look like a bookies.

425
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,160
Why'd we stop here? What's the
matter with that space over there?

426
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,200
It's too tight.

427
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,240
Too tight?

428
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

429
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

430
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,320
Of course I am.

431
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,920
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

432
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,120
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

433
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,040
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

434
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,600
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

435
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,360
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

436
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
I didn't see it.

437
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,720
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

438
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
It was at a funny angle.

439
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
It's behind you, Tyrone.

440
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,840
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

441
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
Control that dog as well.

442
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,600
-Get that dog off him.
-Get it off me.

443
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,200
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

444
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,920
Don't snatch.

445
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,640
He can't swallow the whole ball.

446
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,520
Yeah.

447
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,880
Why the fuck...

448
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,360
...did you put Gorgeous George...

449
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,160
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

450
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,600
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

451
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

452
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,240
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

453
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,800
What the fuck did you expect?

454
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,280
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

455
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,840
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

456
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,440
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

457
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
You did.

458
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,000
You said get a good deal.

459
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,680
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

460
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,880
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

461
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,360
...and a good deal.

462
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

463
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
That his fight won't happen?

464
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,560
We replace the fighter.

465
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,560
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

466
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,600
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

467
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,520
What about John The Gun?

468
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,120
Or Mad Fist Willy?

469
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,480
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

470
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,640
Mad Fist went mad...

471
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
...and The Gun shot himself.

472
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,360
Jesus.

473
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,080
What?

474
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,200
Let's use the fucking pikey.

475
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,800
-How much you gonna pay us?
-10K.

476
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,240
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,200
All right.

478
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,280
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,040
A what?

480
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,400
A caravan.

481
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,080
-Top of the range and all that.
-It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

483
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,880
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

484
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,640
Your what?

485
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
His ma.

486
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,400
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.

487
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,000
They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.

488
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,560
Now I'm changing fighters...

489
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,080
...and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.

490
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,880
He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...

491
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,280
...and aim for penetration.

492
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,640
If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...

493
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,080
...he'd want to split me in half.

494
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,920
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,800
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

496
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,760
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,160
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,120
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,880
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,840
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,200
Well, where'd you lose him?

503
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,880
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

504
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,680
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

505
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,840
We're not backing out.

506
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,880
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,480
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,120
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,440
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,920
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

511
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,160
Mustard?

512
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,960
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

513
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,560
...you can't change fighters.

514
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,880
-You've still got your fight.
-No.

515
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,200
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

516
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,080
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

517
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,960
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,720
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,160
Do you want to get bitten, sweetheart?

520
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,880
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,320
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

522
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,040
This is the one place
I didn't want to be:

523
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,480
In his debt.

524
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,200
Which now means I'm in his pocket.

525
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,120
You're on thin-fucking-ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,920
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
Now, fuck off.

528
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,360
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

529
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,680
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

530
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,400
-When later?
-He said he wanted cash.

531
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,520
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

532
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
A fight?

533
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,520
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,240
-Is there gambling involved?
-It's a boxing match, Avi.

535
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,880
-Did he have a case with him?
-Yes, he had a case.

536
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,440
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

538
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,200
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

539
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,440
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

540
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,200
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,720
I have no idea.

542
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,960
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,760
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

544
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

545
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,480
I'm sure he can pay.

546
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,760
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

548
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,240
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,880
I don't like leaving my own country...

550
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,080
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,760
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,200
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,200
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,160
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,640
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,640
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,520
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,960
Will he be all right?

560
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,440
I hope not.

561
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,680
-Are we gonna rob this bookies?
-Yes, big man.

562
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,920
Why are we waiting?

563
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,760
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,760
And why's that?

565
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,680
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,320
What's in the case?

567
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,640
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

568
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Jesus.

569
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,640
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-I'm well aware of that, my son.

570
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,520
That's why we're here.

571
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,360
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,520
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-We know. That's why we're here.

574
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,120
Tickets.

575
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,640
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,640
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,600
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

578
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,560
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

579
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,520
I'm looking for Franky.

580
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,160
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

581
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,040
-If there's gambling, he'll be here.
-Let's not have a fuck-up.

582
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,560
You won't let us down.

583
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,560
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

584
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,160
Is that him?

585
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,480
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

586
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

587
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,560
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

588
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,880
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything--

590
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,600
What are you doing?

591
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,120
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

592
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,960
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,400
Drop the screen now.

594
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,040
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

596
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,240
-Fill that bag.
-All bets are off.

597
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,080
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
Appreciated...

599
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,480
...but all bets...

600
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,280
...are...

601
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,640
...off.

602
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,120
If all bets are off, then there
can't be any money, can there?

603
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I ain't fucking buying that.

604
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,120
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

605
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,440
What have you got?

606
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,640
Nothing, really.

607
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,080
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,760
Show me your hands.

609
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,440
You've got five fingers.

610
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,640
Copper coins.

611
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,320
What do you mean,
copper-fucking-coins?

612
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,400
It won't open
because it's a security door.

613
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,720
Hold that.

614
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,760
My leg.

615
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,960
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

616
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,480
We're fucked.

617
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,480
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Get us out of here.

619
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,080
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,080
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,480
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

622
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
In the red corner...

623
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,680
...we have the young
and unchallenged....

624
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,000
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,840
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

626
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,760
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,080
...Mickey!

629
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,040
And in the other corner....

630
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,320
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker--

631
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,360
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

632
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,240
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

633
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,840
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,440
Let's get ready...

635
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
...to rumble!

636
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,360
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

637
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,760
What's the fucking crack?

638
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,600
-I'll make it up to you.
-I ain't happy.

639
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,080
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,240
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

641
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,200
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,800
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

644
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,840
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

645
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,560
-He's here.
-Well, you explain it to him.

646
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,160
-What you doing?
-The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,640
So why didn't you chop it off?

648
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,040
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

649
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,560
But he has the case.

650
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,320
Look, we--
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,680
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

652
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,720
Okay.

653
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,520
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,560
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,360
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,320
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,720
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,640
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

659
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,560
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

660
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,160
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

661
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,320
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,880
Watch out!

663
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,880
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,080
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Give me the stone.

666
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,200
-It's in the case.
-What?

667
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,520
It's in the case.

668
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,280
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,200
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,120
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,280
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

672
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,280
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

673
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,960
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

674
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,680
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

675
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,560
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

676
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,440
Once I have that, it's--

677
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,720
Oink, oink.

678
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,520
Shit.

679
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,440
So that's where you keep the sugar.

680
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,040
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,360
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

682
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,840
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

683
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,960
No, we don't, John.

684
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,440
I just had them polished.

685
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,800
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,400
-You take sugar?
-No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm sweet enough.

688
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,280
He's now your problem.

689
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,880
Okay?

690
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,440
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,680
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers....

692
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,160
Well, look at him.

693
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,480
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,280
All right. Of course.

696
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,680
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,280
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

698
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
But this time...

699
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,800
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,600
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,840
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,040
So now you can open it.

703
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,640
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,560
I think he's got away with enough.

705
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,680
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

706
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,760
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,720
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,160
Find them today.

709
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,760
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Tommy.

711
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,960
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

712
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,360
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,960
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yeah.

714
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,040
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,600
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

716
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,920
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

717
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,760
He's coursing.

718
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,440
What's coursing?

719
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,840
Hare coursing.

720
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,440
They set two lurchers--
They're dogs, before you ask.

721
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,800
On a hare.

722
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,360
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,560
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,160
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

725
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
Proper fucked?

726
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,120
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,640
Before "zee" Germans get there.

728
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,520
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,960
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,160
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

731
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,520
John?

732
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,920
I can't help, guv.

733
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,840
Tyrone.

734
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,800
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,960
-Do you want to do it?
-That depends.

736
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,120
On what?

737
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,120
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,640
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,280
-It's not the same caravan.
-Not the same fight.

740
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,400
It's twice the size of the last one.

741
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,480
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,560
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

743
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,560
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

744
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,000
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

745
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,640
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

746
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,080
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,720
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

748
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,240
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

750
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,920
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,520
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,400
I'll tell you what.

753
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,200
Fucker.

754
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,200
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:53,720
You'll what?

756
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,200
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,560
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favour?

758
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,200
I'll do you a favour.

759
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,040
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,240
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,960
If I lose...

762
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,960
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

763
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,560
The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.

764
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,840
However, I don't really
have much of a choice.

765
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,560
Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...

766
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,680
Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.

767
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,840
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,960
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,760
You got that, London?

770
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,960
We're on!

771
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,960
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,240
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

773
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,200
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,360
Who's proper fucked now, then?

775
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,040
There's something very wrong
with this.

776
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,400
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,560
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

778
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,120
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

779
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,760
What? You saying I can't shoot?

780
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,400
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

781
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,400
I know you can't shoot.

782
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,800
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

783
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,920
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,600
You saying the gun don't work?

785
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,120
You tried it?

786
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,160
Whoops.

787
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,480
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,280
Why's he got a tea cosy on his head?

789
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,360
To keep his head warm.

790
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,960
-What happened to him?
-He got shot in the face.

791
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,560
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,040
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

793
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,640
-What do you want me to do?
-Sort it out.

794
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,600
-I'm not a witch doctor.
-But you are a bad boy yardie...

795
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,560
...and bad boy yardies should know how
to get rid of bodies.

796
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,440
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

797
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,200
We're in, governor.

798
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,880
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,400
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,160
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,160
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

802
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,720
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,680
Do you know who I am?

804
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,360
I do.

805
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,080
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,160
Well, I don't.

807
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,880
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

808
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,200
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,920
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,280
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,320
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,880
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

813
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,880
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,400
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,720
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,560
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,520
...for the piggies' digestion.

818
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,720
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,280
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

820
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,960
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,080
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,160
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,480
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,560
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,320
That means that a single pig...

826
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,120
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,280
...every minute.

828
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,760
Hence the expression...

829
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,160
..."as greedy as a pig."

830
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,960
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

831
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,240
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

832
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,240
...apart from someone who feeds people
to pigs, of course.

833
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,160
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

834
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,680
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

835
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,640
...manifested by an
appropriate agent."

836
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,840
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,680
Me.

838
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,480
Gentlemen...

839
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,600
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

840
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,200
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

841
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,000
What about Tony?

842
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,360
Bullet-Tooth Tony.

843
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,440
Who's Bullet-Tooth--

844
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,600
-Tony!
-You silly fuck.

845
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,840
He's a liability.

846
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,160
He'd find Moses and the burning bush.

847
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,760
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,080
He got shot six times,
had the bullets moulded into gold.

849
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,600
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,520
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,360
Why don't you fucking die?

852
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,120
-He's the best chance you got.
-Six times?

853
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,960
In one sitting.

854
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,360
You're in trouble now.

855
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,080
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
Bonjour.

857
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,760
What's so fucking important?

858
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,080
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

859
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,000
-...missing an arm in our office?
-Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,960
You give us four days...

861
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,720
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

862
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,120
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,440
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,800
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,560
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,240
-You got 48 hours.
-Yeah.

867
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,640
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

868
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,040
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,680
After that it's your family...

870
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,640
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

871
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,760
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

872
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,560
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

873
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,080
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

874
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,840
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:54,880
Forty thousand.

876
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,400
Where was he last seen?

877
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,160
At a bookies.

878
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,000
Bookies?

879
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,000
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,840
-Bookies got blagged last night.
-Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,600
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,160
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,640
We'll see a man
that may know something.

884
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,560
I need a gun.

885
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,760
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

886
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,440
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,680
He's stained for fucking life.

888
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,560
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell--

889
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,040
All right, Mullet?

890
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:45,480
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,560
Nice tie.

892
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,360
I heard you weren't about that much.

893
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:52,680
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,000
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,280
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

896
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,640
-Do me a favour, Tone.
-I will do you a favour, Mullet.

897
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,480
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

898
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,760
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,360
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,560
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

901
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,480
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,680
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,400
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,480
-What you think I'm doing?
-Well, don't, Tone.

905
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,440
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

906
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,880
Slow down, Tone.

907
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,120
Slow down, Tony!

908
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,800
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

909
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,160
Play some music if you like.

910
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,320
I love this track.

911
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,040
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

912
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,680
Yes, Mullet?

913
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:56,160
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawn shop in Smith Street.

914
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,080
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:03,480
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

916
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's very effective, Tony.

917
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,200
It's not too subtle, but effective.

918
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,160
Are we taking him with us?

919
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,120
It's the Russian.

920
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,160
A Russian?

921
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,920
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

922
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,520
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

923
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,920
-Give me a name.
-Yurinov.

924
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,480
Boris.

925
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,480
-Boris The Blade?
-Yeah.

926
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,480
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,240
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,480
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,160
He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...

930
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,000
...and you nicked all our savings.

931
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,280
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,880
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

933
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,360
-Are you taking the piss?
-What can I do?

934
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,680
I can't make him do it, can I?

935
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,920
You're not much good to me alive,
are you, Turkish?

936
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:18,600
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

937
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,000
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,600
Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...

939
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,760
...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.

940
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,800
And if that wasn't enough...

941
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,400
...he thought it would be
a good idea...

942
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,280
...to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.

943
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,360
While she was asleep in it.

944
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,200
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,720
You lot...

946
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,800
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

947
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,560
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,600
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

949
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,200
What?

950
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,200
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

951
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,480
Jesus.

952
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,120
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,720
Did you do it?

954
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,120
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,600
-What are you two doing here?
-Come back!

956
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,560
-You got some tars on you.
-Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,760
Fuck off!

958
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,560
How silly do I feel?

959
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,560
His mum is still smoking
next to us...

960
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,760
...and I'm asking him to fight.

961
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,600
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

962
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,920
And if he'd said no...

963
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,480
...it could've been
a shite sight worse.

964
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,680
Russians.

965
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,240
Russians.

966
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,880
I should've known.

967
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,880
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,080
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,240
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,040
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,560
He'll be impossible to track down.

972
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,400
Yeah.

973
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,120
There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-carat stone.

974
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,800
-Where's he from?
-I don't know. Hard to tell.

975
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,280
He's got a thick Russian accent.

976
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,560
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,600
That sneaky fucking Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

978
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,200
First things first. One of us...

979
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,400
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

980
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,000
Now.

981
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,760
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

982
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,000
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

983
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,840
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,520
Not a problem.

985
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,880
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,800
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,880
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,160
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,160
And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.

990
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,400
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,880
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,360
-I think you got something to tell us.
-Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,760
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,280
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,960
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

996
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:21,800
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

997
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,480
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,920
-Yeah.
-Boris is here.

999
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,120
-We're coming over. Hold him there.
-Hold on!

1000
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,360
He's not on his own!

1001
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,560
We're off.

1002
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,360
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,000
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,520
So, where is he?

1005
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,280
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1006
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,400
-They locked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us that?

1007
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,040
Did they look hard?

1008
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,440
They looked messy.

1009
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,400
-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?

1010
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,360
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,920
All right.

1012
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,680
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,760
But this time, try it.

1014
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,880
How far to the Russian's?

1015
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,600
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,680
-Come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,720
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1018
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,680
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1019
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,440
Why? What's wrong with it?

1020
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,480
-It's not in sync with evolution.
-Shut up.

1021
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,040
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,600
-Do you want to shoot him?
-It's a little noisy.

1023
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,600
-Do you want to stab him?
-That's a little cold-blooded.

1024
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,240
-Do you want to kill him or not?
-I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1025
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,800
That's the spirit.

1026
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,440
Do they fire?

1027
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,840
Of course they fire.

1028
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,120
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1029
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,240
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,320
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,640
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,480
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1033
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,160
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,920
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1035
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,400
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,000
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,120
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1038
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:45,120
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,200
Let me do you a favour.

1040
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,080
Whoops.

1041
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,680
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,960
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1043
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,280
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1044
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,720
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1045
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,120
The sharp side, the blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,600
Is that Boris?

1047
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,360
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,040
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,000
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,720
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,040
They're getting out.

1052
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,160
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,320
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,840
You're making a scene.

1055
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,560
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1056
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,920
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,560
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1058
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,240
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,600
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1060
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:33,400
-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1061
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,960
Should we go in?

1062
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,520
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1063
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,640
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,200
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1065
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,200
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1066
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,000
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1067
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:57,120
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:00,920
Well, come on, then
before "zee" Germans get here.

1069
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,280
You just tell him who's in charge.

1070
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,200
Boris--

1071
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,480
You certainly told him.

1072
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,120
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,440
Come and pick us up.

1074
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,720
And Doug...

1075
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,320
...sharpish.

1076
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,480
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1077
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,160
...but unless you give me what
I want there will be fucking murders.

1078
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,800
What's your name?

1079
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,600
Shoot him.

1080
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,160
Let go of the gun!

1081
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,080
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1082
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,560
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1083
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:29,560
There are two types of balls:

1084
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,040
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1085
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,680
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1086
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,360
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1087
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,040
...but they're not clever.

1088
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,480
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1089
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,480
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1090
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,840
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1091
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:56,400
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1092
01:11:58,120 --> 01:11:59,560
There's no pussy here...

1093
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,880
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1094
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,160
Like a prick...

1095
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,640
...you're having second thoughts.

1096
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,360
You're shrinking.

1097
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,840
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1098
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:19,440
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1099
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:28,480
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle .50" ...

1100
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,800
...written on the side of mine...

1101
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,200
...should precipitate...

1102
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,000
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1103
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,200
Now...

1104
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,200
...fuck off.

1105
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,440
Lock the door.

1106
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,920
Lock it!

1107
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,800
Give me the case.

1108
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,080
Fuck you.

1109
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,000
Shoot me.

1110
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,320
I will. I'll shoot you.

1111
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,840
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1112
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,280
You know what?

1113
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,520
Fuck you too.

1114
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,280
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing
me a favour, you Russian fuck.

1115
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,120
You! Drop guns.

1116
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,560
Fuck you!

1117
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,720
You drop your gun!

1118
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,200
Okay.

1119
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,120
Avi...

1120
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,480
...pull your socks up!

1121
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,640
-Tyrone?
-Fuck it. We're out of here.

1122
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,240
Give me case.

1123
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,600
Avi...

1124
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,640
-...where's the case?
-Put the gun away.

1125
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,760
What's Boris doing here?

1126
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,800
Boris, what are you doing here?

1127
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,920
Fuck you!

1128
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,520
Where's the case?

1129
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,400
-You piece of crap.
-Don't take the piss, Boris.

1130
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,720
I'll show you.

1131
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,640
Fuck you!

1132
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
Almost had it.

1133
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,440
For fuck's sake.

1134
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:12,360
Fuck you and all.

1135
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,560
You lucky bastard.

1136
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,480
Jeez, it's flawless.

1137
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:27,800
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1138
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,360
Leave the dog here.

1139
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:34,040
-Sol, why don't we just leave?
-Because life's too short, Vincent...

1140
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,000
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1141
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,520
-Now leave that dog here.
-I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1142
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:41,520
Don't worry about it!

1143
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:45,400
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1144
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:47,920
It's okay.

1145
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,600
Sit down. Down.

1146
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:58,240
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1147
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,640
Well, we won't if you don't.

1148
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,360
All right, you give me the stone...

1149
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,360
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1150
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:11,520
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1151
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,320
Why is it down there?

1152
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,200
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1153
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,160
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1154
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,200
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1155
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,000
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1156
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,320
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1157
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,960
What have they got to do
with anything?

1158
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,320
They're both staring straight at me.

1159
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:48,400
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1160
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,760
Now, out of the car.

1161
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,240
And leave your water pistols behind.

1162
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,640
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1163
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,400
I'll think of something.

1164
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,880
Why's he sweating?

1165
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,160
Oh, never mind.

1166
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,840
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1167
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:14,120
-I'm a little worried, actually.
-Worried about what?

1168
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,360
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1169
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,440
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1170
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,520
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1171
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,160
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1172
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:34,760
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1173
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,120
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1174
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,880
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1175
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,280
You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.

1176
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,840
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1177
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1178
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,760
What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?

1179
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,240
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1180
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,560
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1181
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,520
So why are you so calm?

1182
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,640
-I said--
-I heard what you said, Tommy!

1183
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,920
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1184
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,080
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1185
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,640
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1186
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,240
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1187
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,080
Oh, that fucking dog!

1188
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,960
Go on, get the dog.

1189
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,960
-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
-Open a window.

1190
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,960
You people live like animals.

1191
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,080
Now, where's the stone?

1192
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,440
-Come on, where is it?
-It's over here.

1193
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,640
-Where? Where?
-I left it in a box.

1194
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,640
It's empty.

1195
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,840
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1196
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,760
No, I'm being serious!

1197
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,360
The dog. The dog must have had it.

1198
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,240
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1199
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,040
-What?
-Look in the dog.

1200
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,200
-You mean, "look in the dog"?
-I mean, open him up.

1201
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,560
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1202
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,720
You know what I mean.

1203
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,160
That's a bit strong.

1204
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,080
I don't know about this.

1205
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,200
No, you can't do this.

1206
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,120
It's fucking squeaking!

1207
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,280
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1208
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,400
I'm shooting the dog!

1209
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,880
Shoot the fucking dog!

1210
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,880
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1211
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,360
Thank God for that.

1212
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,600
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1213
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,040
Tony, come on!

1214
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,240
Tony?

1215
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,600
-Anything to declare?
-Yeah. Don't go to England.

1216
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,880
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1217
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,120
How's the dog gonna find the campsite?

1218
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,520
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1219
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:58,600
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1220
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,680
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1221
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,080
That one with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1222
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,240
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1223
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,600
Mickey.

1224
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,680
Mickey!

1225
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,000
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1226
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,840
Need a drink.

1227
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,800
You can't give him a drink!

1228
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,960
It's not for him. It's for me.

1229
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,280
Ah, mates. Amen.

1230
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,240
He's a hard bastard, this Good night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1231
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,520
All right, Mickey?

1232
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,520
Mickey!

1233
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,520
Need to have a shite!

1234
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,200
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1235
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,440
...shoot the bastards.

1236
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,040
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1237
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,160
All right, Tom.

1238
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,040
-Hope we get a better show this time.
-This will make up for it.

1239
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,480
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1240
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,120
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1241
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,960
Now, you have to forgive me.

1242
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,720
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1243
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,680
-Our lads at the campsite?
-They're over there now.

1244
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,000
I fucking hate pikeys.

1245
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,800
-How long have we gotta stay here?
-As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1246
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,720
Fucking hate pikeys.

1247
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,720
Is he fucking stoned?

1248
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:00,120
He's like that before a fight.

1249
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,640
Do you know when you're going down?

1250
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,320
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1251
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,640
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1252
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,400
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1253
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,920
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1254
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,360
-Not now.
-Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1255
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,320
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1256
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,960
And there none a yours.

1257
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,960
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1258
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,360
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1259
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,640
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1260
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,760
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1261
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,120
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1262
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,440
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1263
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,320
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1264
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,440
Talk about saved by the bell.

1265
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,400
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1266
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:58,840
Do not knock him out, Mickey.

1267
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,840
All right, let's break it up.

1268
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,840
What, is he fucking deaf?

1269
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,920
What is he doing?

1270
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,320
Come on and sit.

1271
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,920
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1272
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,160
You're dancing like a fairy.

1273
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,960
They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.

1274
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,760
Get out there and hurt him.

1275
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,800
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1276
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,600
All he's got to do is stay down.

1277
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,080
Now, we are fucked.

1278
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:53,960
He can't stand up.

1279
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:54,920
We're out of here.

1280
01:29:55,240 --> 01:30:00,080
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...

1281
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,680
...sitting outside his campsite.

1282
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,680
Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.

1283
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,000
Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?

1284
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,640
Give me that fucking shooter!

1285
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,440
And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.

1286
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:17,800
So, what do you do?

1287
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,400
Something very silly.

1288
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,520
You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...

1289
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,160
...because you're too scared
to think.

1290
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,360
You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.

1291
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:31,760
But the pikey didn't. Why?

1292
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,680
Because he had plans
on running the car over.

1293
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,000
It had previously occurred to me...

1294
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,400
...that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.

1295
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,080
For every action,
there is a reaction.

1296
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,160
And a pikey reaction...

1297
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,120
...is quite a fucking thing.

1298
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,400
Pete, talk to me.

1299
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:38,080
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1300
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,120
-Give me that fucking shooter.
-I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1301
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,320
That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.

1302
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,680
That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.

1303
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,080
We've been tucked up...

1304
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,200
...while he's been cleaning up.

1305
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,760
We're worse off now than
when we started.

1306
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,360
The next day we went
to the campsite...

1307
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,640
...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.

1308
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,760
Which was probably a good thing...

1309
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,240
...considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.

1310
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,840
Where is he?

1311
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,120
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1312
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,280
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1313
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,640
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1314
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,840
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1315
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,080
Bollocks! Come on.

1316
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,840
-What you doing here?
-What's it got to do with you?

1317
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:07,640
So, what you doing here?

1318
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,680
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1319
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:20,160
What's in the car?

1320
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,280
Seats and a steering wheel.

1321
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,120
What do you know about gypsies?

1322
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,720
I know they're not to be trusted.

1323
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,320
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1324
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,560
Get the dog, Tommy.

1325
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:38,560
The dog.

1326
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:44,360
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1327
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,680
He loves that dog.

1328
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,680
Always playing silly games.

1329
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,160
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1330
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,520
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1331
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,320
Could you tell me...

1332
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,680
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1333
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,240
Hey, George...

1334
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,680
...is that a tea cosy on his head?

1335
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,280
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1336
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,240
Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.

1337
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,960
I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.

1338
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,560
I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.

1339
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,040
The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...

1340
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,440
...and an 84-carat diamond
lodged in its stomach.

1341
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,440
It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.

1342
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,720
Still didn't shut it up, though.

1343
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,360
So, what do you do?

1344
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,400
You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.

1345
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,120
So, what do you think?

1346
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,920
Do you know anyone who'd be interested?
