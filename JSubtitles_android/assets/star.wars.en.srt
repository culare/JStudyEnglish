1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,280
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,440
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,240
With all due respect...

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,440
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
Yes, of course.

6
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,440
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

7
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,480
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

8
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm TC-1 4 at your service.

9
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
This way, please.

10
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,280
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,200
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,480
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,480
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,360
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,720
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

21
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,240
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,400
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,240
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,520
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,480
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,360
I knew it.

28
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,640
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,880
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,320
Send a droid.

33
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,680
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,840
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,120
What is it?

37
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,800
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,320
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,040
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

40
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,240
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,800
Begin landing your troops.

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,480
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,800
I will make it legal.

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,120
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,640
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

46
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,440
Kill them immediately.

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,680
Yes, my lord .
As you wish.

48
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,200
Captain, look!

49
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
Shields--

50
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Sorry.

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Dioxis.

52
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,400
They must be dead by now.

53
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,080
Destroy what's left of them.

54
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,160
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,120
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

56
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,840
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,520
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,080
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,960
That will hold them.

66
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,680
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,640
This is impossible!

68
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,680
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360
They have shield generators!

71
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,360
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,760
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,480
Sir!

74
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,160
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,160
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,480
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,080
Let's split up.

79
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,280
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,600
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,600
At last we are getting results.

85
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,880
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,560
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

88
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,840
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

90
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,560
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

91
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,240
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,280
Beware, Viceroy.

94
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,000
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

95
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,000
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
You assume too much.

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,960
We will see.

98
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,360
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,320
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,600
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,480
Negotiations haven 't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

102
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,680
How could that be true?

103
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,960
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

104
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,680
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,320
- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

106
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,240
What's happening?

107
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,160
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,920
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,240
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,000
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,840
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,400
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,040
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,320
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,400
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,320
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,480
and there is no trace of the Jedi.

120
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

121
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,720
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,000
Use caution.
These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

123
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,960
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,680
Get down!

125
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,040
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,600
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,360
I spake.

129
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,520
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,400
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,440
Mesa culled JarJar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it'tis.

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,440
'Tis demanded by the gods, it'tis.

134
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,400
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,080
You saved my again.

136
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,560
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,920
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,720
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,920
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,120
Can you take us there?

143
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,360
On second thought, no.

144
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,040
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,960
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,040
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,080
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,080
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,800
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,400
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,880
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,640
Oh.

154
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,120
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,360
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,280
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,360
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,000
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
So good bein home!

162
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,440
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,800
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,720
Mesa back.

165
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,640
Noah gain, JarJar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

167
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,360
How wude.

168
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,960
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,440
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,240
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,800
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,600
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,520
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,600
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,800
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,720
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,080
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,800
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,880
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,680
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,520
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,600
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,240
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
Now...

187
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
go.

188
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,280
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,360
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,360
A transport, I hope.

191
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,200
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,280
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,880
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,880
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,840
What is to become
of JarJar Binks here?

198
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,680
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,880
I saved his life.

200
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,400
He owes me
what you call a "Iife-debt."

201
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,200
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,560
Binks...

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,480
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

204
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,720
Begone wit him!

205
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,560
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,960
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,200
- Why were you banished, JarJar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,160
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,880
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,320
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,200
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,400
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,400
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord .

218
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

219
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,760
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

220
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,400
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,360
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

222
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,800
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

223
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,720
Yes, my lord .

224
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,880
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,200
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,800
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,400
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,960
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,920
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,800
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Power's back.

235
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
Monster's back!

236
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,560
Relax.

237
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
You overdid it.

238
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,120
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,080
Oh, boy.

240
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,640
Ah, victory.

242
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,960
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,120
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,560
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,640
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,760
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,440
Process them.

250
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,280
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,960
Roger, roger.

252
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,720
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,400
Get their weapons.

254
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,320
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,160
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,080
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,360
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,800
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,520
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,040
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,800
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,880
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,480
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,640
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,640
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,040
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,520
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,440
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,360
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,080
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,800
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,360
I'll deal with that.

279
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Halt.

280
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,240
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,880
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,840
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,240
Come on. Move!

286
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,320
Go!

287
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,000
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,720
Hello, boyos.

289
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,360
There's the blockade.

290
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,600
How wude!

292
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,720
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,040
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
The shields are gone.

295
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,400
The power's back!

296
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,400
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,000
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,760
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,640
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,560
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,360
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,280
How can you be sure?

304
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,040
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,360
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,280
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,680
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

311
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,280
She has disappeared, my lord .

312
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,320
I want that treaty signed.

314
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,400
My lord...

315
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,960
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,200
It's out of our range.

317
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,480
Not for a Sith.

318
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,840
This is my apprentice...

319
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,800
Darth Maul.

320
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,240
He will find your lost ship.

321
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,600
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,680
Now there are two of them.

323
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,680
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,160
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,040
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,360
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,960
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,440
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
Padmй.

330
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,960
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,960
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,160
Continue, Captain.

333
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,760
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,840
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,440
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,360
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,280
Hello.

339
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,240
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm Padmй.

341
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,720
Mesa JarJar Binks.

342
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,760
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,400
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,040

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,840
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,880
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,120
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,600
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,800
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,960
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,520
Wait!

356
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,920
Wait.

357
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,960
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,680
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,960
The queen wishes it.

361
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,920
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,320
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,280
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,080
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,000
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,320
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,280
Like us.

368
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,240
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,200
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,000
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,280
Good day to you.

372
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,200
What do you want?

373
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,280
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,280
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,720
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,840
What took you so long?

378
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,960
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,720
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,960
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,880
We'll find what you need.

382
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,920
Don't touch anything.

383
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,600
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,280
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,160
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,760
They live on the moons of Iego,
I think.

387
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,040
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,840
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,080
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,000
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,320
How long have you been here?

392
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,280
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,000
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,720
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,560
You're a slave?

396
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,640
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,360
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,760
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,560
Hit the nose.

400
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,440
A T-1 4 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,080
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,560
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,480
Saying of which...

404
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,880
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,960
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,840
Republic credits?

407
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,880
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,480
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

410
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,360
No, they won't!

411
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,480
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,680
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,720
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,200
And no one else has a T-1 4 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,880
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,280
We're leaving. JarJar.

417
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,240
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,120
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,520
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,440
Clean the racks.

422
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
Then you can go home.

423
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,680
Yippee!

424
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,760
And you're sure there 's
nothing left on board?

425
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,680
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,720
The queen's ward robe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,080
not in the amount
you're talking about.

428
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,440
I'll check back later.

430
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,800
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,640
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,120
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,280
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,280
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,000
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,360
Oops.

437
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,480
Is this yours?

438
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,280
Who, mesa--

439
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,320
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,360
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,880
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,720
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,760
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,240
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,080
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,000
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,520
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,080
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,040
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,960
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,960
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,600
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,160
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,840
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

456
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,680
We'll be right there.

457
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,920
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,520
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,840
My bones are aching.

460
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,320
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,160
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,160
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,000
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,480
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,760
Mom!

467
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,440
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,840
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,360
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,760
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,760
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,280
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,640
He's wonderful.

474
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,480
You really like him?

475
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,400
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,880
Where is everybody?

477
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,120
Whoops.

478
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,320
Oh, hello.

479
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,600
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,520
How might I serve you?

481
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,320
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,840
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,800
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,800
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,840
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,440
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,960
The death toll is catastrophic.

490
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,360
We must bow to their wishes.

491
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,440
You must contact me.

492
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,120
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,160
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,120
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,040
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

496
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,520
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,640
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,440
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,360
Move against the Jedi first.

500
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,080
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,000
to sign the treaty.

502
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,640
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,520
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,920
They will be no match for you.

506
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,440
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,360
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,840
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

509
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,240
How wude!

510
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,680
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,600
The Republic's antislavery laws--

512
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,160
We must survive on our own.

514
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,560
Xcuse me.

515
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,000
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,840
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,560
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,120
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,120
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,520
Don't do that again.

521
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,240
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,840
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword .

523
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,720
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,520
I don't think so.

526
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,720
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,480
I wish that were so.

528
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,560
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,720
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,040
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,320
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,640
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,640
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
on a very important mission.

535
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,720
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,320
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,600
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,160
I believe you can.

539
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,960
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,680
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,200
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,440
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,760
Podracing.

544
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,680
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,560
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,880
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,880
You could enter my pod.

548
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,720
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,640
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,880
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,520
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,040
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,200
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,720
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,040
Anakin.

556
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,800
Your mother's right.

557
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,880
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,920
No.

559
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,240
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,640
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,600
We'll find some other way.

562
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,320
There is no other way.

563
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,600
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,240
He was meant to help you.

565
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,040
Are you sure about this?

566
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,680
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,760
The queen will not approve.

568
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,680
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,320
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,920
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,600
How can you do this?

572
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,880
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,080
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,200
Not bad!

575
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,160
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,440
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,960
What would the boy ride?

578
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,480
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,840
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,520
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,880
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,320
That you did.

583
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,120
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,640
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,360
The fastest ever built.

586
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,400
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,680
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,120
and I supply the boy.

589
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,960
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,880
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,520
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,600
If we win...

593
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,360
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

594
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,560
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

595
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,280
Either way, you win.

596
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,120
Deal!

597
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,200
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,640
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,360
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,920
Well, it 's too dangerous
to call for help...

601
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,280
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,280
And...

603
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,200
there's something about this boy.

604
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,000
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,960
He gives without any thought
of reward .

606
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,840
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,000
He has--

608
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,760
He has special powers.

609
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,640
Yes.

610
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,280
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,080
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,000
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,800
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,160
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,080
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,880
Who was his father?

617
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,320
There was no father.

618
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,920
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,160
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,480
Can you help him?

621
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,400
I don't know.

622
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,280
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,680
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,120
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,080
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,840
With this?

627
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,600
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,800
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,000
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,280
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,760
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,200
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,640
Okay.

634
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,640
My tongue is fat.

635
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,720
My tongue-- Wrench.

636
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,400
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,160
I'm stuck.

638
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,120
You know, I find that JarJar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,600
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,720
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,960
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,040
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,280
My mouth.

644
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,680
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,760
My tongue is fat.

646
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,720
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,800
Thank you.

648
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,280
Go.

649
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,680
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,280
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,160
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,080
Most of them.

653
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,080
Has anyone been to'em all?

654
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,880
Not likely.

655
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,080
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,520
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,280
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,160
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,560
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,160
Go on.

661
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,160
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,080
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,640
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

664
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,360
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,120
Wait a minute.

666
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,640
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,000
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,920
Over 20,000.

669
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,520
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

670
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,360
No Jedi has.

671
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,440
What does that mean?

672
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,840
I'm not sure.

673
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,680
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,480
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,760
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,600
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,600
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,960
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,080
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,560
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,720
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,920
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,640
Oh, no!

684
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,400
Why do you think that?

685
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,320
He always wins!

686
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,600
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,960
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,880
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,800
the boy and his mother.

690
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,480
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,040
The boy, then.

692
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,400
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,800
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,840
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,040
Red...

696
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,960
his mother.

697
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,600
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,760
but you won't win the race!

699
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,880
So it makes little difference!

700
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:55,000
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,000
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,440
Good morning.

703
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,120
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,960
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,320
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,480
Do what?

707
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,520
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,320
You've never won a race?

709
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,040
Well, not exactly.

710
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,080
Not even finished?

711
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,560
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,640
Of course you will.

713
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,840
That's absolutely right.

714
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,800
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,400
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,120
Isee Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

717
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,920
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

718
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,080
Sebulba!

719
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,040
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,080
Ma whonic!

721
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,200
A hearty hello...

722
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,880
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

723
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,640
And back again,
it 's the mighty Dud Bolt...

724
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,160
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

725
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,560
And hoping for a big win today...

726
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,920
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

727
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,720
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

728
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,080
a local boy.

729
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,840
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,720
Be safe.

731
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,080
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,160
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,440
you slave scum.

734
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:09,680
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,080
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,600
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,280
Right.

738
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,760
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,160
I will.

741
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,400
May the Force be with you.

742
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,920
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,960
Welcome.

744
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,000
Begin the race!

745
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,160
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

746
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,120
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,440
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

748
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,320
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

749
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,560
You should too.

750
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,680
You assume too much.

751
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,720
Start your engines.

752
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,600
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,040
Oh, no!

754
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,600
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,680
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

756
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,440
Come on, Ani!

757
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,120
And there goes Skywalker!

758
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,640
Go, Ani, go!

759
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,800
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

760
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,680
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

761
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,000
on the canyon dune turn.

762
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,320
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,040
Oh, no!

764
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,440
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,680
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,680
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

767
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,880
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,520
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,160
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,520
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,920
Here he comes!

772
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,040
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba 's in the lead...

773
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,560
followed closely by Skywalker!

774
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,520
Go, Ani!

775
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,680
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,840
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,960
It's Skywalker!

778
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,160
Sebulba!

779
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,360
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,160
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,520
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,960
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,440
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,840
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,040
They're side by side!

786
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,320
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,000
I can't believe it.

788
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,960
The crowds are going nuts!

789
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,480
Yay, Ani!

790
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,680
Mom, I did it! Yay!

791
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,560
Good going, Ani!

792
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,640
We owe you everything, Ani.

793
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,200
It's so wonderful, Ani.

794
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,920
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

795
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,160
I'm so very proud of you.

796
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,000
You!

797
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,320
You swindled me.

798
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,080
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

799
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,000
I lost everything.

800
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,520
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

801
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,000
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

802
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,080
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

803
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,360
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

804
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,320
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

805
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,840
I'm sure they can settle this.

806
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,080
Take him.

807
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Hidoe!

808
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,320
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

809
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,440
I'm going back.

810
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,560
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

811
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,000
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

812
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,760
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

813
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,680
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

814
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,240
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

815
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,440
Come on. Hup!

816
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,680
Hey. These are yours.

817
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,800
Yes!

818
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,400
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

819
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,800
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

820
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,760
- And he has been freed.
- What?

821
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,600
You're no longer a slave.

822
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,280
Did you hear that?

823
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,400
Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.

824
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,080
You are free.

825
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,920
Will you take him with you?

826
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,600
Is he to become a Jedi?

827
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,160
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

828
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,560
Nothing happens by accident.

829
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,080
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

830
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,560
Anakin...

831
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,560
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

832
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,440
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

833
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,600
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

834
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,440
Can I go, Mom?

835
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,960
Anakin...

836
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,880
this path has been placed
before you.

837
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,360
The choice is yours alone.

838
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,680
I wanna do it.

839
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,280
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

840
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,160
What about Mom?

841
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,960
Is she free too?

842
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,440
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

843
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,320
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

844
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,200
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

845
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,600
It is time for you to let go.

846
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,720
I don't want things to change.

847
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,120
But you can't stop the change...

848
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,200
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

849
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,080
I love you.

850
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,320
Now hurry.

851
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,960
Thank you.

852
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,880
I'll watch after him.
You have my word .

853
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,480
Will you be all right?

854
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,280
Yeah.

855
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,640
Hello, Master Anakin.

856
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,760
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

857
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,160
and I'm going away in a starship.

858
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,080
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

859
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,240
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

860
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,360
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

861
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,440
give you coverings and all.

862
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,120
I'm gonna miss working on you.

863
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,600
You've been a great pal.

864
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,240
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

865
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Sell me?

866
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,680
Bye.

867
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,120
Oh, my.

868
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,880
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

869
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,920
Will I ever see you again?

870
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,080
What does your heart tell you?

871
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,200
I hope so.

872
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,720
Yes.

873
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,360
I guess.

874
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,840
Then we will
see each other again.

875
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,120
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

876
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,880
I promise.

877
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,640
Now, be brave...

878
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,320
and don't look back.

879
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,880
Don't look back.

880
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,680
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

881
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,480
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

882
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,760
Go!

883
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,600
Tell them to take off!

884
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,080
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

885
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,640
Take off.

886
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,000
Over there. Fly low.

887
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,600
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

888
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,200
What was it?

889
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,000
I'm not sure...

890
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,560
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

891
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,080
My guess is
it was after the queen.

892
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,600
What are we gonna do about it?

893
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,040
We shall be patient.

894
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,240
Anakin Skywalker...

895
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,080
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

896
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,840
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

897
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:10,880
Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...

898
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,920
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

899
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,080
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

900
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,600
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

901
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,600
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

902
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,520
Take him away.

903
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,200
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

904
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,760
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

905
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,400
They will not
stay hidden for long.

906
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,600
The death toll is catastrophic.

907
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,240
We must bow to their wishes.

908
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,480
You must contact me.

909
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,880
You all right?

910
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,720
It's very cold.

911
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,000
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

912
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,400
A little too warm
for my taste.

913
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,680
Space is cold.

914
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,840
You seem sad.

915
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,120
The queen is worried.

916
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,560
Her people are suffering, dying.

917
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,040
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

918
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,640
I'm not sure what'll happen.

919
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,000
I made this for you...

920
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,240
so you'd remember me.

921
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,480
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

922
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,320
It'll bring you good fortune.

923
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,240
It's beautiful.

924
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,640
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

925
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,400
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

926
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,960
but my caring for you will remain.

927
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,560
I care for you, too, only l--

928
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,760
Miss your mother.

929
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,480
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

930
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,280
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

931
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,520
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

932
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,720
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

933
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,680
With the communications break down,
we've been very concerned.

934
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,160
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

935
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,800
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

936
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,800
Welcome, Your Highness.

937
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,880
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

938
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,400
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

939
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,880
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

940
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,280
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

941
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,360
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

942
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,280
There is a question
of procedure...

943
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,800
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

944
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,680
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

945
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,480
The situation has become
much more complicated.

946
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,840
Ani, come on.

947
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,200
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

948
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,360
Pitty hot.

949
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,120
There is no civility,
only politics.

950
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:45,080
The Republic
is not what it once was.

951
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:50,240
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

952
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,280
There is no interest
in the common good.

953
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,680
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

954
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,400
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

955
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,120
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

956
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,040
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

957
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,280
the chancellor
has little real power.

958
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,120
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

959
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,840
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

960
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,320
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

961
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,560
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

962
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,760
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

963
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,640
and give us justice.

964
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:29,760
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

965
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,280
He has been
our strongest supporter.

966
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,400
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

967
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,720
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

968
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Our people are dying, Senator.

969
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:47,240
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

970
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,760
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

971
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,280
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

972
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,800
for the time being.

973
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,480
That is something I cannot do.

974
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,000
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

975
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,880
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord .

976
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,320
Impossible.

977
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,000
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

978
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:20,120
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

979
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,200
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

980
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:26,080
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

981
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:29,280
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

982
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,000
May the Force be with you.

983
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,280
Master Qui-Gon.

984
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,840
More to say have you?

985
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,680
With your permission, my master...

986
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,040
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

987
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,040
A vergence, you say.

988
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,200
Located around a person?

989
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,520
A boy.

990
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:56,040
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

991
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,880
I have seen in a life-form.

992
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,760
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

993
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,120
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

994
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,920
You believe it's this boy?

995
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,520
- I don't presume to--
- But you do.

996
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,120
Revealed your opinion is.

997
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,200
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

998
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,320
Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

999
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,720
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

1000
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,000
I have no doubt of that.

1001
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,360
Bring him before us, then.

1002
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,800
The boy's here to see Padmй.

1003
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,440
Let him in.

1004
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,240
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmй's
not here right now.

1005
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,960
Who is it?

1006
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,600
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmй,
Your Highness.

1007
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,440
I've sent Padmй on an errand.

1008
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,360
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1009
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,640
to start my training, I hope.

1010
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,120
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1011
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,640
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1012
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

1013
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:35,080
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1014
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,840
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1015
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,200
a tragedy has occurred...

1016
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,680
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1017
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,680
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1018
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,720
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1019
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,920
This is outrageous!

1020
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,480
I object
to the senator's statements.

1021
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,480
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1022
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,320
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1023
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,360
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1024
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,280
who speaks on our behalf.

1025
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,680
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1026
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,760
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1027
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,640
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade--

1028
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,160
I object!
There is no proof!

1029
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,080
This is incredible.

1030
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,000
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1031
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,360
The Congress of Malastare...

1032
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:41,360
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1033
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,440
A commission must be appointed.

1034
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,960
- The point--
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1035
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,640
Enter the bureaucrat.

1036
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,280
The true rulers of the Republic.

1037
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,400
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1038
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,560
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1039
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,280
The point is conceded.

1040
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,920
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1041
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,720
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1042
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,640
I will not defer.

1043
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,120
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1044
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,120
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1045
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,800
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1046
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:23,880
If this body
is not capable of action...

1047
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,960
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1048
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,360
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1049
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,400
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1050
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,240
Vote now! Vote now!

1051
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,720
Order!

1052
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,600
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1053
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,520
a strong chancellor...

1054
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:55,440
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1055
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,160
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1056
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,280
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1057
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,000
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1058
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,720
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1059
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:15,160
If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.

1060
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,240
They will not go along
with you this time.

1061
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,160
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1062
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,640
A ship.

1063
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,080
A cup.

1064
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,920
A ship.

1065
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,400
A speeder.

1066
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,480
How feel you?

1067
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,640
Cold, sir.

1068
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,320
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1069
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,960
See through you we can.

1070
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,880
Be mindful of your feelings.

1071
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,640
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1072
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,600
I miss her.

1073
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,160
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1074
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,320
What has that got to do
with anything?

1075
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,680
Everything.

1076
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,720
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1077
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,600
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1078
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,920
Hate leads to suffering.

1079
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:26,000
I sense much fear in you.

1080
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,640
Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?

1081
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,040
I don't know.

1082
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,120
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1083
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,440
I hope not.

1084
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,320
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1085
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,240
Wesa warriors.

1086
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,480
Wesa got a grand army.

1087
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,680
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1088
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,080
Your Highness?

1089
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,680
Your Highness...

1090
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,760
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1091
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,200
as supreme chancellor.

1092
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,040
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1093
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,360
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1094
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,080
Who else has been nominated?

1095
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,320
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1096
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,160
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1097
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,720
I will be chancellor.

1098
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:37,320
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1099
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,520
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1100
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,440
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1101
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,960
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1102
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:51,320
Senator, this is your arena.

1103
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,520
I feel I must return to mine.

1104
01:29:56,640 --> 01:29:58,840
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1105
01:29:58,960 --> 01:29:59,800
Go back?

1106
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,760
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1107
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,160
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1108
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,960
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1109
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,600
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1110
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,920
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1111
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,840
Stay here where it's safe.

1112
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,320
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1113
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,000
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1114
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,800
The Force is strong with him.

1115
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,760
He is to be trained, then?

1116
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,080
No, he will not be trained.

1117
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,800
No?

1118
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,720
He is too old.

1119
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:50,480
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1120
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,000
Clouded this boy's future is.

1121
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,880
I will train him, then.

1122
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,760
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1123
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,680
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1124
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,080
Impossible to take on a second.

1125
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,800
The code forbids it.

1126
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:16,160
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1127
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,760
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1128
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:23,240
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1129
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,000
but he is capable.

1130
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,040
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1131
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,160
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1132
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,760
Now is not the time for this.

1133
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,400
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1134
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,080
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1135
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,280
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1136
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,600
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1137
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:50,920
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1138
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,640
This is the clue we need...

1139
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,240
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1140
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,040
May the Force be with you.

1141
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,440
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1142
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,360
From your point of view.

1143
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,720
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1144
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,600
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1145
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,000
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1146
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,920
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board .

1147
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,960
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1148
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:39,200
You won't be, Ani.

1149
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,160
I'm not allowed to train you...

1150
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,240
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1151
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,360
Always remember:

1152
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:48,760
Your focus determines your reality.

1153
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,320
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1154
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,760
Master, sir...

1155
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,320
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1156
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,800
I've been wondering--
What are midi-chlorians?

1157
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:04,320
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1158
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,600
that resides
within all living cells.

1159
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,760
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1160
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,200
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1161
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,040
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1162
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,920
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1163
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,720
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1164
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,640
They continually speak to us...

1165
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,320
telling us the will of the Force.

1166
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,440
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1167
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,360
you'll hear them speaking to you.

1168
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,280
I don't understand.

1169
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,760
With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.

1170
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:45,240
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1171
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,280
I welcome your help.

1172
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,960
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1173
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,960
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1174
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,840
Wesa goin' home!

1175
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,760
Come on, R2.

1176
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,880
Is the planet secure?

1177
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,720
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1178
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,800
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1179
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,960
Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...

1180
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:23,880
things stay as they are.

1181
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,360
I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.

1182
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:29,280
Yes, my lord .

1183
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,200
A Sith here?

1184
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,760
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1185
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,160
And those two control the pitch?

1186
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:44,480
You catch on pretty quick.

1187
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,280
As soon as we land...

1188
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,920
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1189
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,040
I agree.

1190
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,800
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1191
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:55,280
I will take back what's ours.

1192
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:58,120
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1193
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,040
We have no army.

1194
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:01,480
And I can only protect you.

1195
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:03,560
I can't fight a war for you.

1196
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,560
Jar Jar Binks.

1197
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,520
Mesa, Your Highness?

1198
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,440
Yes. I need your help.

1199
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,600
I have one battleship on my scope.

1200
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,680
It's a droid control ship.

1201
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,920
They've probably spotted us.

1202
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,680
We haven't much time.

1203
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,480
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1204
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,840
Good.

1205
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,120
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1206
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,800
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1207
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,040
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1208
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,720
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1209
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,400
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1210
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,400
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1211
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,320
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1212
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,280
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1213
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,160
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1214
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,920
Desa nobody dare!

1215
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:29,120
The Gungan city is deserted!

1216
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,680
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1217
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,760
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1218
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,120
More likely they were wiped out.

1219
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:40,160
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

1220
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,560
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1221
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:46,440
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1222
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,480
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1223
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:17,080
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1224
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,160
Jar Jar Binks.

1225
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:23,760
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1226
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,520
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1227
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:29,640
I come before you in peace.

1228
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,480
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1229
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,640
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1230
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:39,320
Yousa all bombad.

1231
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:42,880
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1232
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,320
Your Honour.

1233
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,240
Whosa dis?

1234
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,480
I am Queen Amidala.

1235
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:54,600
This is my decoy...

1236
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:58,200
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard .

1237
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,440
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1238
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,000
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1239
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,560
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1240
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:12,320
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1241
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:15,560
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1242
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,800
I ask you to help us.

1243
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,520
No, I beg you to help us.

1244
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,920
We are your humble servants.

1245
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,720
Our fate is in your hands.

1246
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:49,320
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1247
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:55,440
Mesa lika dis!

1248
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,280
Maybe...

1249
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,840
wesa...

1250
01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:01,760
being friends.

1251
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:11,840
We've sent our patrols.

1252
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,280
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1253
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,480
It won't be long, my lord .

1254
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,600
This is
an unexpected move for her.

1255
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,640
It 's too aggressive.

1256
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:25,080
Lord Maul, be mindful.

1257
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,640
Let them make the first move.

1258
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,560
Yes, my master.

1259
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:34,560
Deysa comin!

1260
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,960
All right!

1261
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,040
They're here!

1262
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,480
Good. They made it.

1263
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,440
Yousa doen grand.

1264
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,520
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1265
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,440
Oh, no, no, no.

1266
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,400
So, wesa make you...

1267
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,920
bombad general.

1268
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,400
General?

1269
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,760
Captain.

1270
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,360
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1271
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,280
Almost everyone's in camps.

1272
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,480
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1273
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,040
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1274
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,920
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1275
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,640
and much stronger.

1276
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,840
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1277
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,080
The battle is a diversion.

1278
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,960
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1279
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:31,560
R2.

1280
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:35,960
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1281
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,720
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1282
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,800
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1283
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,720
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1284
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,120
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1285
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:48,840
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1286
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,040
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1287
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,560
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1288
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,880
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1289
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,520
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1290
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,800
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1291
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,920
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1292
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,840
We will send
what pilots we have...

1293
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,880
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1294
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,920
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1295
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,040
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1296
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,720
There's an even bigger danger.

1297
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,640
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1298
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,880
he will return
with another droid army.

1299
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,080
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1300
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,040
Everything depends on it.

1301
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,680
She is more foolish
than I thought.

1302
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,680
We are sending all troops...

1303
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,560
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1304
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:44,200
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1305
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,760
This will work to our advantage.

1306
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,560
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord ?

1307
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,960
Wipe them out.

1308
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,400
All of them.

1309
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,360
Halt!

1310
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,840
Starting up the shield.

1311
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:01,320
Open fire.

1312
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:19,840
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1313
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,800
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1314
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,080
Roger, roger.

1315
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,800
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1316
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:52,280
This is too close.

1317
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,280
Ani, find cover.

1318
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,600
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1319
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,040
Fighters straight ahead.

1320
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,240
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,520
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1322
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:11,880
Cease fire.

1323
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:21,440
Steady. Steady.

1324
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,280
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1325
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,960
Ouch time.

1326
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,520
Fire!

1327
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:51,640
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1328
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,160
Red group! Blue group!

1329
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,000
Everybody, this way!

1330
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:57,080
Hey, wait for me!

1331
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:59,480
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1332
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,520
- But l--
- Stay in that cockpit.

1333
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:16,280
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1334
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,480
We gotta do something, R2.

1335
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,240
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1336
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,480
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1337
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:09,800
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1338
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:11,800
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1339
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,840
Yeah!

1340
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,440
Let's go!

1341
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,640
It's on automatic pilot.

1342
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,160
Try to override it.

1343
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,600
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1344
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,240
Look, there they are.

1345
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,640
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1346
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,480
Dumb droid. Take that!

1347
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:05,440
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1348
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:06,680
Get off!

1349
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,600
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1350
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,120
This is tense!

1351
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,240
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1352
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,160
It's gonna get us both killed.

1353
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,080
You did it, R2!

1354
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,360
Let's go left.

1355
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,440
Go back?

1356
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,680
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1357
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,640
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1358
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,520
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1359
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,040
Go!

1360
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,320
Ascension guns!

1361
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,880
Retreat! Retreat!

1362
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,400
Dis is nutsen.

1363
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,760
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1364
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,960
Give me a lift!

1365
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:09,440
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1366
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,400
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1367
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,400
Here. Taken dis one.

1368
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,200
Jar Jar!

1369
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,200
Jump, Jar Jar, jump!

1370
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,640
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1371
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,080
We're hit, R2!

1372
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,600
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1373
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:23,000
Everything's overheated.

1374
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,280
Oops. This is not good.

1375
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,880
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1376
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,800
Mesa think of something.

1377
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:41,240
Hands up.

1378
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:44,120
My give up. My give up.

1379
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,480
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1380
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:57,400
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1381
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,320
this pointless debate in the senate.

1382
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,120
Viceroy!

1383
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:03,080
Your occupation here has ended.

1384
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,840
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1385
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,560
Captain!

1386
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:26,400
Jam the doors.

1387
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:32,480
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1388
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,480
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1389
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,640
Take this!

1390
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,600
And this!

1391
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,840
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1392
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,720
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1393
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,160
Impossible!

1394
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,080
Nothing can get through our shield.

1395
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,040
Let's get outta here.

1396
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:10,280
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1397
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:14,720
We didn't hit it.

1398
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:19,640
Now, this is Podracing.

1399
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:22,840
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1400
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,760
What the--

1401
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:47,000
Was'n they doing?

1402
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:50,560
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1403
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,440
They all broke-ed.

1404
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,120
No, it's too late.

1405
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,440
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1406
02:00:47,680 --> 02:00:49,480
Promise--

1407
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:52,040
Promise me
you will train the boy.

1408
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:53,640
Yes, Master.

1409
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:00,040
He is the chosen one.

1410
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,240
He will bring balance.

1411
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,760
Train him.

1412
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,880
Now, Viceroy...

1413
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,280
you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.

1414
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:42,120
I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.

1415
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,680
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1416
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,600
And you, young Skywalker.

1417
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:04,520
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1418
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,240
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1419
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:16,640
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1420
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:19,040
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1421
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:22,920
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1422
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:32,000
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1423
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:36,640
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1424
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,560
I do not.

1425
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:40,680
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1426
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:46,040
The chosen one the boy may be.

1427
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:47,720
Nevertheless...

1428
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,600
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1429
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:54,680
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word .

1430
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,640
I will train Anakin.

1431
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:01,040
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1432
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:03,520
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1433
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:05,480
Need that you do not.

1434
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:10,760
Agree with you the council does.

1435
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,000
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1436
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:43,360
What will happen to me now?

1437
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:46,400
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1438
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:49,800
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1439
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:02,080
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1440
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,560
Always two there are.

1441
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:07,760
No more, no less.

1442
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:10,680
A master and an apprentice.

1443
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:12,280
But which was destroyed?

1444
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,240
The master or the apprentice?

1445
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,840
Hidoe, everybody!

1446
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:27,400
Peace!
